These are the necessary files from CSparse to compile cs_dmperm.c,
which implements the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition.

CSparse: a Concise Sparse Matrix package.
Version 2.2.0, Copyright (c) 2006-2007, Timothy A. Davis, Mar 31, 2007.

Refer to "Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems," Timothy A. Davis,
SIAM, Philadelphia, 2006.  No detailed user guide is included in this
package; the user guide is the book itself.

The algorithms contained in CSparse have been chosen with five goals in mind:
(1) they must embody much of the theory behind sparse matrix algorithms,
(2) they must be either asymptotically optimal in their run time and memory
    usage or be fast in practice,
(3) they must be concise so as to be easily understood and short enough to
    print in the book,
(4) they must cover a wide spectrum of matrix operations, and
(5) they must be accurate and robust.
The focus is on direct methods; iterative methods and solvers for
eigenvalue problems are beyond the scope of this package.
