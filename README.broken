On branch try-shared-multigon:

Got some way to converting multigon to be handled by shared_ptr, so edges could properly point to it.  Had to convert everything to pointers.

I think I hit a big problem in swap: multigons have edges, but edges point back to multigons, so I think I have circular dependencies.  The right behavior might be for edges to have weak_ptr's to multigons?
